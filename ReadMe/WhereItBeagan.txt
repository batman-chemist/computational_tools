# computational_tools
Computational tools that may one day be combined to be a small computational quantum chemistry package.
All the programs in this repository will have a GNU GPLv3 license. 
Any corrections that you feel is needed even in this README file itself can be notified. 
This is a pet project and hoping it wil be helpful to more programmers and scientists working with C program. 
Why C program? Just keeping it simple while learning my around computational quantum chemistry.
